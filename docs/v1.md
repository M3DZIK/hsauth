# Version 1 - 0x01

This version uses X25519 cryptographic for generating authentication keys.

## Generating Key

To generate the authentication key between the user and the server, this version uses a shared key secret using the X25519 cryptographic algorithm.

```
X25519ComputeSharedSecret(userPrivateKey, serverPublicKey) -> hsAuthKey
```

## Validating Key

To validate the authentication key, the server doing the same thing, but uses its private key, and the user's public key.

```
X25519ComputeSharedSecret(serverPrivateKey, userPublicKey) -> hsAuthKey
```

Verification will pass if the keys generated by the server and the user are the same.
